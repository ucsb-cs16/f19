<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL! </b>

1.(5 pts) What is the output of the following program? Using a pointer diagram show the evolution of all data objects in memory, clearly marking elements on the run-time stack and on the heap. Mark the size of all data objects. Assume the code is embedded in a correct and complete program.
<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int *p1, *p2, *p3;
p1 = new int;
p2 = new int;
p3 = p1;
*p1 = 20;
*p2 = 30;
cout<< *p1<< " "<< *p2<<" "<<*p3<< endl;
p1 = p2;
cout<< *p1<< " "<< *p2<<" "<<*p3<< endl;
*p3 = *p2;
cout<< *p1<< " "<< *p2<<" "<<*p3<< endl;
```

2.(5 pts) What is the output of the following program? Using a pointer diagram show the evolution of all data objects in memory, clearly marking elements on the run-time stack and on the heap. Mark the size of all data objects. Assume the code is embedded in a correct and complete program.
<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int array_size = 4, *a ;
a = new int[array_size];
int *p = a;
for(int i=0; i< array_size; i++)
    *(a+i) = 2*i;
p[0] = 10;
for(int i=0; i< array_size; i++)
    cout<<a[i]<<" ";
cout<<endl;
```
</div>




3.(5 pts) Write the definition of a structure type called UndergradStudents. This structure should contain student ID numbers, first and last names, major, and GPA scores for each undergraduate year.
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

4.(10 pts) Write a program that uses the definition of the structure UndergradStudents from the previous question to *declare* and then *initialize* an array of 3 objects of this structure (hint: you can do this with the same approach you define/initialize an array of any other type). You **must initialize the values in the program, not by user input**.  The initial values are shown in the table below. Then write the definition of a function with the signature <code> void printRecords(UndergradStudents *records, int numrecords);</code> The function should print out the values of the array of objects passed to it as shown in the sample below, along with each student's AVERAGE GPA score (calculated to a precision of 2 decimal places). You **must use a loop to print the output**. Your program should appropriately call the printRecords() function to print the student records and the average GPA.

<div markdown="1">
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
|ID | First name| Last Name| Major | GPA Yr1|  GPA Yr2| GPA Yr3| GPA Yr4
|1 | Joe | Shmoe | EE | 3.8 | 3.3 | 3.4 | 3.9
|2 | Macy | Chen | CS | 3.9 | 3.9 | 4.0 | 4.0
|3 | Peter | Patrick | ME | 3.8 | 3.0 | 2.4 | 1.9

OUTPUT:

```
These are the student records:
ID# 1, Shmoe, Joe, Major: EE, Average GPA: 3.60
ID# 2, Chen, Macy, Major: CS, Average GPA: 3.95
ID# 3, Peter, Patrick, Major: ME, Average GPA: 2.77
```

5.(3 pts) In C++, all the files are opened in ______________ mode:

    (a) Binary

    (b) Text
 
    (c) Can't say


<div class="pagebreak"></div>



6.(5 pts)Please fill the program below to make it output the expected output:
<div markdown="1">
  ```cpp
      #include <fstream>
      #include <iostream>
      #include <string>
      using namespace std;

      int main ()
      {
         string data;
         _____________ outfile;
         outfile.open("file.dat");
         cout << "Writing to the file" << endl;
         cout << "Enter class name: ";
         ___________________________________________
         outfile << data<< endl;
         cout << "Enter your id: ";
         cin >> data;
         outfile << data<< endl;
         outfile.close();
         ifstream infile;
         cout << "Reading from the file" << endl;
         infile.open("file.dat");
         ___________________________________________
         cout << data << endl;
         ___________________________________________
         cout << data << endl;
         infile.close();
         return 0;
      }
  ```
