1.(2 pts) Consider the 'head' variable on page 741. What is the value of head for an empty list?
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>


2.(6 pts)  Assume you are given a pointer to the head of an existing list (named head). The nodes of the linked-list are of type struct Node (as defined on display 13.7 on page 754). Write a for-loop to iterate through the list and print the data of every other element of the list (starting with the first element).
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>


<div class="pagebreak"></div>


<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

3.(2 pts) In the implementation of a linked list in lab07, why does struct Node contain a pointer member variable of type Node *?
<div style="margin-bottom:6em"></div>



4.(10 pts) Define a struct Node to represent a node in a double linked-list that stores a string as data. Write a function to insert a node to the head of the linked list. The function takes two arguments: a pointer to the first node in the double linked list and a string value. It should create a new node with the given value to the head of the double linked list.
<div style="margin-bottom:6em"></div>
</ol>
