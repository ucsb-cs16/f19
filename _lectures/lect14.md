# Topics
* Practice with small single-linked list
* Intro to double-linked lists (define the types we will be working with in the upcoming classes LinkedList, Node)
* Basic operations on double-linked lists: insert, delete, and iterating through the linked list
* Problems with dynamic memory: memory leaks and dangling pointers
* Dynamic memory pitfalls: memory leaks (how to avoid and detect (valgrind))
* Detecting memory errors: Use valgrind

- To run your code in valgrind use the following command:

```
valgrind --leak-check=full <name of your executable>
```
