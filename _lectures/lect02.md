# Code from lecture


# Topics


# Code anywhere and everywhere with git 

## What is git?
* Git is a version control system (VCS). A VCS allows you to keep track of changes in a file (or groups of files) over time
* Git allows you to store code on different computers and keep all these different copies in sync 

## Why are we learning git in this class?
* Collaborate 
* Share code ownership
* Work on larger projects
* Provide feedback on work in progress
* Learn professional software development tools

## Git concepts
* repo (short for repository): a place where all your code and its history is stored
* remote repo: The repo created on github.com. You can access a remote repo via a browser (we'll explore other ways later)

* In class demo:
	- creating a repo on github.com
	- adding collaborators to the repo
	- adding files to the repo
	- Updating files in a remote repo using a web browser
    - Viewing the version history
	
* cloning a repo: Once you have created a repo, you (and your collaborators) can copy (or clone) it on different computers. Each instance is now a local repo, because it exists on your (local) computer rather than the web.
* Using git command line tools, we can sync up different repos. This means multiple collaborators can work on the same code on different machines.
