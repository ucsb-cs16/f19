1.(10 pts) Consider a linked list where each node is a node in a singly-linked list defined as follows:

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
struct Node{
  int data;
  Node* next;
};
```

Complete the definition of the function deleteNode given below, that takes as input a pointer to the head of the list, and an integer value. The function should delete all the nodes in the list whose data members have the given value. If the list is empty or if there is no node with the given value, the function should not do anything.
}
<div markdown="1">
```cpp
void deleteNode(struct Node*& head, int value);






















```

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

For all the following questions, use the definitions of the struct Node and struct LinkedList from lab 07.

<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

2.(10 pts) Implement a function that returns the number of even elements in a linked list. Test your code before writing it out. Illegible code will receive 0 credit. Below is the declaration of the function
<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int countEven(LinkedList* list);
```

</div>

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

3.(10 pts) Implement a function that takes a linked list and the number of elements in the list as input and returns a dynamic array containing the data elements of the linked list. Test your code before writing it out. 
<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int* linkedListToArray(LinkedList * list, int len);
```
