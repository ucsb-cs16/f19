# Code from lecture


## Review: Designing nested loops
* When do we need a loop?
* When do we need a nested loop?
* Checking for limits
* Practice with ASCII art (also topic of lab02)

## Three key aspects of functions
* Declaration (what are the inputs, outputs?)
* Definition  (actual code for achieving the desired behavior)
* Function call (using function)


## C++ Memory Model
* Program layout in memory: text, global data , heap and stack
* The stack and its purpose
